      <b>Project Description:</b>
      <br>
        "Into the Wilderness" is a digital video piece for Art 75 that depicts a recent camping trip I went on. Its purpose is to document the small beauties of nature, and to shed light on small details that may not be noticed to the naked eye, while keeping an orangey autumn aesthetic. I also wanted to capture all types of organic movement in nature, which can be seen in the clips. This assignment was one of the first times I had experimented with real video editing techniques, so it was relatively new. I spent many days exploring various video, sound, and color effects, which led me to this final product. I am very proud of this piece, and how much it brought me out of my own comfort zone.
