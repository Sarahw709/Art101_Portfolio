        <b>Project Description:</b>
        <br>
     This piece for Art 3 is meant to serve as a deliberation of what it means to yearn for something that is beyond physical reach, but rather a memory of the past. It illustrates a television screen in the center of the image, containing a VHS video of a little girl playing surrounded by bright and vivid colors. Outside of the television, two hands are reached out from a darker first-person view, barely grasping a television remote and attempting to touch the screen. At the bottom of the image, covered in shadow, it can be observed that the hands are locked in handcuffs. The warm colors in the VHS video are meant to make viewers feel a nostalgic comfort, while the dark shadows surrounding the television are meant to invoke dreariness or dullness.I chose digital media(ProCreate) as my material because I wanted this piece to be a physical art work rather than conceptual, and this is a medium I am familiar and comfortable with.  By illustrating both my younger self and my current self in the image, I wanted it to not only feel personal to myself but to the viewers as well.
