      <b>Project Description:</b>
      <br>
        My final piece for Art 75, titled "Fragmented Memories" encapsulates me going through the motions of my everyday life, while piecing together memories from my childhood that I have flashbacks of throughout my day. Throughout the video, we see the childhood memories slowly become less and less blurred and distorted, signifying the memories becoming clearer to me as I remember. I filmed videos from an old TV, part of the reason being I wanted viewers to feel like they were watching from an old TV just like I was. I then recorded moments from my current daily life, and used clips that 'triggered' these old memories and reminded me of the childhood clips being presented. To create the effect of the memories being distorted and foggy, I used various different Premiere Pro audio and visual effects, such as distorted echos and lens distortion. As the video progressed, I allowed the distortions to become less and less effective, to give the idea that the memories are slowly starting to become more clear to me. This leads up to the final ending scene, where I dream about a childhood memory that is finally vivid in my imagination. I am extremely proud of this piece I produced in the end, as it challenged me to further explore video editing techniques.
