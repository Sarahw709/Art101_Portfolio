        <b>Project Description:</b>
        <br>
        This piece was created for an Adobe Illustrator class at Las Positas Community College. The purpose was to practice and become more comfortable with the digital platform, and the prompt was 'cult leaders'. I created this piece on the famous cult leader Marshall Applewhite, who is commonly associated with his strong universal faith, and his belief in UFOs. I utilized Illustrator's pen tool and challenged my own creativity to produce an imaginative depiction of Applewhite, that perfectly encapsulated who he was and what he was known for. By this time, I was already fairly comfortable with my using this platform, but producing this art piece made me more proud of how my skills and confidence were advancing.
