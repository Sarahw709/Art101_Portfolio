      <b>Project Description:</b>
      <br>
          For this final project in Art 74, the prompt was to create a short video animation that mimicked a self-playing video game on Adobe After Effects. For my assignment, I wanted to create a very cute and comical cartoon video game. To create the visual design, I utilized Adobe Illustrator's pen tool to make a cute yet simple design. I then exported the design to After Effects, where I animated the image frame by frame. The game consists of two cats fishing for fish on a lake, and the goal is to catch 3 fish that are swimming by. This was one of my first times animating on After Effects, so this was fun yet intimidating to experiment and play around with. Although it took me a long amount of time to animate, and there was much trial and error, I am satisfied and proud of the end result.
