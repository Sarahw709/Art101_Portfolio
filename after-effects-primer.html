         <b>Project Description:</b>
         <br>
         For this Art 74 assignment, the goal was to become familiar with Adobe After Effects by creating a short looping clip. The theme was to make a piece inspired by a famous art movement, so I chose the Suprematism movement. I stuck with the abstract visuals that encapsulate that theme, and added in little figurines made during that movement using Photoshop. I also stuck with a more neutral color palette, which I felt also added to the theme. This was the first time I had ever used After Effects or any kind of animation techniques, so it was intimidating at first. After various experimentation and trial and error, I came up with this short looping video that brought me out of my comfort zone.
